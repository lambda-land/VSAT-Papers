* Notes
** change plain set for several new terms
** heuristics to determine whether or not a better encoding would matter
** use the vcore to derive a more optimal vpl formula
** Minimize variational core problem
** Improve variational formulas to variational formulas
*** Given a v-formula, reorder it to be better
** Incremental VSAT
*** skip
** Applications
*** Everywhere SATs are used in SPL community
*** take paper that has tool
**** run tool on data
**** tech diff, trace the sat problems
*** hack type chef
**** to spit out sat problems for vsat
*** Partial evaluation
**** Partial evaluation of linkers

** Summary

*** Further evaluation

*** Novel ways to use what we already have

*** Working on an algorithm for better encoding

*** Extending what we already have

** Must do

*** Maximize the sharing

**** shared sub-expression minimization

** Next paper

*** journal paper

**** Three dimensions of contributions:

***** new applications

***** type chef benchmarks

***** new implementation technique: concurrency

***** Optional: proof of soundness

** Send a summary of the conversation
